# ABOUT

This prototype was part of the work done for an intership at NotAGameStudios for a Digital Games Development course that I took. All work on this project (with the exception of the music track) was done by me.

This project is a 2D multiplayer rhythm game with a level editor(for developers), responsive elements to input and accuracy, made in Unity Engine.
